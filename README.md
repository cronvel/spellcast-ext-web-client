# Spellcast's Caster Extension

It's like “make”, but with a touch of wizardry!

This is an extension for [Spellcast!](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spellcast).

It uses the powerful Spellcast Scripting language to create powerful *Spellbook* used as a task runner (project builder, etc).

The documentation will be written soon.
